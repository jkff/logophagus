 - TODO comments in sources
 - Plugin: highlight lines matching pattern
    Make it work

 - Plugin: split by value of field. Splits a log into many sublogs based on their field value.
    User says, "Look at 10000 first records"
    We scan them and gather values of the field
    Tree:
        Field=A
        Field=B
        Field=C
        Field=Other

 - Bookmarks. They should work through filters, too. Consider both cases where a bookmarked position
   corresponds to a record that is accepted by the filter and when it is rejected.
