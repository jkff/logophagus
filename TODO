GUI should be like this:
Menu (File -> Open,exit is enough)
Window is split into 2 parts: views tree, current view.
Views tree has initially a root node corresponding to the raw log.
Right-click on a node in the views tree pops up a list of views that may be derived from the node (plugins supply this information about their capabilities).
The first plugin is a "Filter by substring" plugin.
