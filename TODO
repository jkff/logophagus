 - TODO comments in sources
 - Plugin: highlight lines matching pattern
    analysis plugin + visualization plugin
    LogTable should be configurable with a highlighter.

    User says, "Look at 10000 first records"
    We scan them and gather values of the field

        Field=B
        Field=C
        Field=Other
