 - TODO "Merge logs" plugin. Input: any number of logs (of any format); for each log, the time axis is indicated. 
    See paper
 - Read logs with user-specified format pattern (regex; 1 capturing group = 1 field ; list of field names)

14:35:56<TAB>DEBUG<TAB>Hello world

format.txt:
Time,Level,Message
(\d\d:\d\d:\d\d)\t([^\t]+)\t(.*)

 - Find some example large apache or IIS log, try using program on it

 - TODO Multiple inheritance for attributes (so that bookmarks and highlighters of merged logs show up in the merge result, too)

 - TODO figure out how to get rid of scrollbar
 + TODO Scrolling with mouse wheel should work not only in the limits of the current loaded fragment.
 + TODO Split by field values: combobox with field names instead of input textbox
    - TODO Fix combobox issue (nothing can be selected)

 - TODO (in case merge turns out to be too slow because of priority queue copying in MergeLogs.next()) Use an immutable (purely functional) priority queue there. See, for example, Okasaki "Purely functional data structures" or take one from the internet

    static Number add(Number a,Number b);
